# react-redux-smart-templates
A set of React/Redux templates for use with [atom-smart-template](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov/atom-smart-template)

## Usage

I'm gonna assume you use atom, because if you don't then there's really no point in you being here. If you don't currently use atom but the idea of templates for your react-redux components is so exciting that you're ready to make the jump, go install atom, we'll wait here.

#### 1. Install [`atom-smart-template`](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov/atom-smart-template)

If you've never installed an atom package before or you need a refresher check out [atom's documentation](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages)

#### 2. Open up the templates directory

Once you have `atom-smart-template` installed you can find the templates directory using the Packages menu. Use the following path to open the directory in finder

`Packages > Smart templates > Open templates folder`

#### 3. Clone this repo

#### 4. Copy the template folders from this repo into the `atom-smart-template` templates folder

#### 5. Stop writing boilerplate component code, because now you don't have to

When you right click on any folder in your project you'll now see the option to `Create files from template`. Click on that and you'll get a list of all the templates you have installed, which should now include an awesome list of react-redux stuff. Choose the type of component you'd like to create and follow the prompt to save approx. 17 seconds of your life (it doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up...)
